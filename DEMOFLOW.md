Challenges Faced

Modal 
-Modals are present even when not displayed - their properties can be changed
-Bugs from Referencing modals by ID - single most time consuming source of bugs
-document.getElementById
-label htmlFor 
-Unique element IDs are important!!
-5 composers overlaid so it looks like 1 - edit top one only - all data going to right place but editing wrong modal

Standardized components
-Text boxes with rounded edges? 
-Align center or align left? 
-Navbar on every page? How tall? 
-Dealing with absolute positioned components can be troublesome
-Retro-synchronization could be avoided

Git
-Work out of own branch, push to dev branch
-What if dev was updated since my last pull? Eg day 1 iggy and I git pull origin dev, day 2 iggy submits PR to dev, day 3 what do I do if i want to submit PR without reverting Iggyâ€™s work?
-Accidental git push - disabled direct pushing to main and dev without PR
-PR reviews by both other team members
-For the most part 1 person per feature at any 1 time

Data structures
-Synchronisation of organisation across database and storage
-Data - room or user specific? Who can edit? How to link user and room?
-room/user/data or user/room/data?
->user/userdata and room/roomdata, link by room/username
-which values must be unique? (eg users can choose non unique display name but identifiers can break when they change it or we have both users in the same room with same display name)
-Auth doesnâ€™t store room data or even a room name - we need to match user data from Auth to room data from Database

Creating rooms
-Signup - How do we ensure we donâ€™t have random people joining rooms not intended for them?
-How do we ensure only the intended 2nd user joins the 1st userâ€™s room?
